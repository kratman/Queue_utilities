Qtop:
-Functionality smartphone terminals may be limited or buggy. The $TERM
environment variable should be xterm not linux and UTF-8 should be enabled.
-Qtop is not as pretty as pbstop, but it was designed for systems that lack
common tools.
-Tests were performed on Gnome terminal, xterm, Konsole, and JuiceSSH.

SCPpath:
-Might not properly handle .. or ~/ in the paths.
